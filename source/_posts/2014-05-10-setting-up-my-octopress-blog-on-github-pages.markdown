# Deploying

I'm going to be using Github pages to deploy my blog so I followed the instructions and executed the ```rake setup_github_pages``` command.

    rake setup_github_pages
    Enter the read/write url for your repository
    (For example, 'git@github.com:your_username/your_username.github.io.git)
               or 'https://github.com/your_username/your_username.github.io')
    Repository url: git@github.com:ddewaele/ddewaele.github.com.git
    rm -rf _deploy
    mkdir _deploy
    cd _deploy
    Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/ddewaele/octopress/octopress/_deploy/.git/

    ## Now you can deploy to git@github.com:ddewaele/ddewaele.github.com.git with `rake deploy` ##

Note that I'm still using a ```github.com``` suffix for my pages. Github has recently switched to ```gitub.io```

I had also  already setup a "default" user page using github pages that contained some static html that was generated by th Github pages wizard.

So when I ran ```rake deploy``` it seems to run fine at first but i got the following error:

    rake deploy
    ## Deploying branch to Github Pages 
    ## Pulling any updates from Github Pages 
    cd _deploy
    warning: no common commits
    remote: Reusing existing pack: 17, done.
    remote: Total 17 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
    Unpacking objects: 100% (17/17), done.
    From github.com:ddewaele/ddewaele.github.com
     * [new branch]      master     -> origin/master
    You asked me to pull without telling me which branch you
    want to merge with, and 'branch.master.merge' in
    your configuration file does not tell me, either. Please
    specify which branch you want to use on the command line and
    try again (e.g. 'git pull <repository> <refspec>').
    See git-pull(1) for details.
    
    If you often merge with the same branch, you may want to
    use something like the following in your configuration file:
    
        [branch "master"]
        remote = <nickname>
        merge = <remote-ref>
    
        [remote "<nickname>"]
        url = <url>
        fetch = <refspec>
    
    See git-config(1) for details.
    cd -
    rm -rf _deploy/index.html

    ## Pushing generated _deploy website
    To git@github.com:ddewaele/ddewaele.github.com.git
     ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
    error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:ddewaele/ddewaele.github.com.git'
    To prevent you from losing history, non-fast-forward updates were rejected
    Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull') before pushing again.  See the
    'Note about fast-forwards' section of 'git push --help' for details.
    
    ## Github Pages deploy complete
    cd -

The reason for this erro is because there was a conflict between waht was already on my github pages repository and what was generated by octopress

In order to solve this you need to ensure that your ```_deploy``` folder is in a state so that changes can be pushed.

What octopress was trying to do was this:

    cd _deploy/
    git push
    
    To git@github.com:ddewaele/ddewaele.github.com.git
     ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
    error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:ddewaele/ddewaele.github.com.git'
    To prevent you from losing history, non-fast-forward updates were rejected
    Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull') before pushing again.  See the
    'Note about fast-forwards' section of 'git push --help' for details.

The reason why this push was failing is because we had ```non-fast-forward``` updates.

This becomes clear when you try to pull in the changes from the remote repository

    cd _deploy/
    git pull origin master
    
    warning: no common commits
    remote: Reusing existing pack: 17, done.
    remote: Total 17 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
    Unpacking objects: 100% (17/17), done.
    From github.com:ddewaele/ddewaele.github.com
     * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
    Auto-merging index.html
    CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in index.html
    Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

As you can see, a ```conflict``` was introduced on ```index.html```. This is why octopress wasn`t capable of deploying the site.


So we need to resolve these conflicts.


## Your blog source

You'll notice when doing a ```git status``` that octopress has created a git repository in your ```octopress`` folder that is currently checked out on the source branch

git status

# On branch source
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#   modified:   Rakefile
#   modified:   _config.yml
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#   sass/
#   source/
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")


It has setup a gitignore file to ensure that your deploy folder doesn't get deployed to github pages.
 
    cat .gitignore 

    .bundle
    .DS_Store
    .sass-cache
    .gist-cache
    .pygments-cache
    _deploy
    public
    sass.old
    source.old
    source/_stash
    source/stylesheets/screen.css
    vendor
    node_modules


And it has the following git config.

    cat .git/config 
    [core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
        ignorecase = true
    [remote "octopress"]
        url = git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/octopress/*
    [branch "source"]
        remote = origin
        merge = refs/heads/master
    [remote "origin"]
        url = git@github.com:ddewaele/ddewaele.github.com.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*

In order to commit the source code to your blog

    git add .
    git commit -m 'your message'
    git push origin source
